\section{Exercise X: Market Basket Analysis}

\subsection*{Introduction}
This exercise applies Market Basket Analysis to a grocery transaction dataset.
Each row represents a single shopping basket containing one or more items.
The objective is to identify frequent item combinations and derive association rules that describe which products tend to be purchased together.

\subsection*{Methodology}
The raw file \texttt{groceries3.csv} was loaded and converted into a list of transactions, where each transaction is a list of item names.
Using the \texttt{TransactionEncoder} from \texttt{mlxtend}, the transactions were transformed into a one-hot encoded matrix.

The Apriori algorithm was applied with a minimum support threshold of 1\%.
From the resulting frequent itemsets, association rules were generated and evaluated using support, confidence and lift.

TBA

Rules with lift greater than 1 indicate that the antecedent and consequent co-occur more frequently than expected under independence.
For example, a rule of the form
\[
\{\texttt{butter}\} \Rightarrow \{\texttt{whole milk}\}
\]
with high confidence and lift suggests that customers who buy butter are more likely than average to also buy whole milk.

\subsection*{Conclusion}
The tables show that Market Basket Analysis can uncover meaningful patterns in grocery transaction data.
Frequent items and itemsets highlight core products and common shopping combinations, while association rules with high lift reveal non-random relationships between items.
These insights can support product placement, bundling strategies and recommendation systems.
